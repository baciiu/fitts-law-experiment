Planning: 

-	make the canvas responsive. 
-	draw squares on canvas 
-	draw the squares given the 4 directions 
-	make sure the given amplitudes are correctly implemented 
- 


- REFACTOR THE CODE
- make a list of all data that should be in the csv tables. !!


Feature: 
- make the canvas resposive 

Feature: 
- retrieve random canvas point for showing the shapes. currently only showed in the center of the canvas 
    Subtask:    
    - make sure that all points are within the canvas.

Feature 
- make more possible shapes in different sizes.


Feature 
- make another type of randomized algorithm for retrieving the trials

Feature
- add diagonal directions 


Amplitude: center of start to center of target

pixels ratio to display fix and make sure you can use the linear to check the pixels . 

Feature 
flag for choosing the center of the canvas as point 
flag for choosing random point on the canvas 

choose a maxim distance for the next start from the last target. THis should be a parameter. 


make a big(a parameter input) circle around target. Find poitions where this circle fits the screen. Then store the posible points on the radius(given the directions) and retrieve them as random. 

Lange strecke minimieren


Start shape shoulkd didsasaper and target should get another color.



!!!
Block ii set cu alta ordine. tot atatea trials.

WICHTIG:

if the click meant for target was made too close to start shape, 
if ( )
if ditance from click to target is smaller than (half the amplitude or a given variable)
then add another trial to the set because it might have been a failure/ will not be considered.

the trial should be added just to that block, but not the next trial (only if the trial was the last one.)

Loggging

wo is start 
wo is target

4 timestamps:
- time 0 mouse press start und x,y
- time 1 mouse release start und x,y
- time 2  mouse press target und x,y
- time 3 mouse release target und x,y

- add all distances combinations please. 
Example
- user number test of 144 randuri
- trial nummer test of 144
- block number 
- Trial in block
- Amplitude mm  
(width and heugth )
- amplitude in px 
(width and heugth )
- diagonal number 
- time 0 local time WElt uhr zeit in long  / system.getTime. in java 
- for all time 
- t1-t0 from press to release in target 
- ...
- t3-t0 from press in start to release in target 

- distances for all combination as well


- press in traget 0 oder 1 
- releaae in traget 0 oder 1
