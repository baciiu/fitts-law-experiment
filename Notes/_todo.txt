-background dark grey, almost black. 

- The start square was light grey and measured 10 Ã— 10 mm. 


- The target was yellow. 

- A text label in the upper right corner of the screen informed the participants about how many trials they had completed within the current series of trials. 

- A text label in the upper left corner of the screen showed how many trials remained until the next break. 

- A break screen appeared after every 22 trials (for a total of seven breaks per series of 176 trials). 

All participants started with one series of mouse pointing trials followed by one series of touch pointing trials. 

All participants completed 15 practice trials before each series of timed trials. 

The mouse pointing and the touch pointing series each contained one trial with each of the 176 different pointing tasks (details below) in random order.

- The timing in mouse pointing trials started after a press-and-release event sequence with the left mouse button while the screen cursor was inside the start square. 


- The application played an error sound if the participant moved the cursor outside the start square while still pressing down the left mouse button. 

On an error, the participant released the mouse button and moved the cursor back inside the start square to issue a new press-and-release sequence. 

- The target turned green after a successful trial start and a second press-and-release event sequence with the left mouse button ended the trial. 

- That is, a trial ended whether or not the cursor was inside the target. 

- The application played a beep-sound if the participant missed the target. 


- Timing stopped when the participant pressed down the mouse button (not with the release) and the application painted the next task at a random position on the screen.

- The timing in touch pointing trials started after a touchdown-liftoff event sequence with the pointing finger inside the start square. 

- The application played an error sound if the liftoff hap- pened outside of the start square. On an error, the participant tried again. 

- The target turned green after a successful trial start and a second touchdown-liftoff event sequence ended the trial. 

Similarly, as with the mouse, a trial ended whether or not the finger was inside the target, and the application played a beep-sound if the participant missed the target. 

Timing stopped with the touchdown event (not with the liftoff event) and the application painted the next task at a random position on the screen.

I followed instructions used in earlier studies (MacKenzie, 1992; Wobbrock et al., 2011) and asked my participants to try to complete each trial as quickly as possible while maintaining an approximate 5% error rate. Participation lasted approximately 40 minutes.
