### Bachelor Project @University of Klagenfurt 
# Measuring User Performance for Pointing at 2D Targets


## Description

The project simulates two types of experiments to illustrate Fitts's Law:

* *__Discrete Experiment__* : Users are required to move the cursor from a starting point to a target shape (square and rectangles).

* *__Reciprocal Experiment__* : Users are required to move the cursor back and forth between two target shapes (rectangles or squares) repeatedly. 

At the end of each experiment a .csv file will be generated. This file contains the data about user's actions during the experiment.

The aim is to measure the time taken for each movement and analyze the consistency and speed of the user's actions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* install Node.js and NPM 

### Executing program

* run following command in terminal 
```
npm start
```
